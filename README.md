# A RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) app in Python 

Here I am building a python RAG apication that can let you query/chat with your PDFs using generative AI.

This project contains covers:
* Run RAG apps locally (with Ollama).
* Update a vector DB with new items. 
* Use RAG with PDFs (or any other files).
* Test the quality of AI generated responses.
